# Bayesian-SLA-project
This project is divided in four parts; our goal is to study and do bayesian statistical inference
in the PRO-ACT Dataset, a database that contains some clinical informations about people who have the SLA.
There are four steps: 

1)Elaborate a very wide dataset to make it usuful for statistical analysis;

2)Do some fvc's tecnical analysis ( fvc is a variable linked to the breathing capacity);

3)Do a survival analysis of the patient at time 0;

4)Try to perform a joint model that can link a multi-step survival analysis with a longitudinal FVC analysis.
